# 🧠 Machine Learning Project Structure Guide

This guide explains the purpose of each folder and file in your ML project. It's designed to help you (and your team) understand how everything fits together — whether you're building, deploying, or maintaining the project.

---

## 📁 data/ — Where does your data live?
**Purpose**: This is where all your datasets are stored.

- `raw/`: Original data, untouched (like downloading a CSV from Kaggle).
- `interim/`: Data that’s been cleaned a bit but not ready for modeling.
- `processed/`: Final, clean data ready for training.
- `external/`: Data from third-party sources (e.g., APIs, external databases).
- `README.md`: Explains how to use or update the data folders.

🧠 Think of it like your kitchen pantry — raw ingredients go in `raw/`, chopped veggies in `interim/`, and cooked meals in `processed/`.

---

## 📁 docs/ — Where do you explain your project?
**Purpose**: Documentation for humans — helps others (and future you) understand your project.

- `design.md`: How the system is structured (like a blueprint).
- `api.md`: If your project exposes an API, this explains how to use it.
- `deployment.md`: Instructions on how to deploy the project (e.g., on a server or cloud).

🧠 Like a user manual or guidebook for your project.

---

## 📁 infrastructure/ — How do you run this project in the real world?
**Purpose**: Contains files to help deploy or run your project in different environments.

- `docker/`: Dockerfile to containerize your app.
- `kubernetes/`: Configs to deploy on Kubernetes clusters.
- `terraform/`: Infrastructure as code — used to provision cloud resources.

🧠 Think of this as the “DevOps toolbox” — it helps you move from local to production.

---

## 📁 models/ — Where do your trained models go?
**Purpose**: Stores your machine learning models.

- `production/`: Final models used in real-world applications.
- `staging/`: Models being tested before going to production.
- `experiments/`: Experimental models you're still working on.

🧠 Like different shelves in a lab — tested, approved, and experimental models.

---

## 📁 monitoring/ — How do you keep an eye on your model?
**Purpose**: Tracks how your model performs over time.

- `drift/`: Detects if the input data has changed (data drift).
- `performance/`: Tracks metrics like accuracy, precision, etc.

🧠 Like a health monitor for your model — is it still doing its job well?

---

## 📁 notebooks/ — Where do you experiment and explore?
**Purpose**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration, prototyping, and reporting.

- `exploration/`: Try out ideas, visualize data.
- `prototyping/`: Build early versions of models or pipelines.
- `reports/`: Generate visual reports or summaries.

🧠 Like a scientist’s lab notebook — messy but full of insights.

---

## 📁 pipelines/ — How do you automate your ML workflow?
**Purpose**: Organizes your ML workflow into steps.

- `training/`: Scripts or configs for training models.
- `deployment/`: Scripts for deploying models (e.g., to a server or cloud).

🧠 Like a recipe — step-by-step instructions to go from raw data to predictions.

---

## 📁 src/ — Where does your actual code live?
**Purpose**: The heart of your project — all reusable Python code.

### Subfolders:
- `data/`: Code to load, clean, and transform data (`make_dataset.py`, `preprocess.py`).
- `features/`: Code to create and select features (`build_features.py`, `feature_selection.py`).
- `models/`: Code to train, predict, evaluate models (`train.py`, `predict.py`, `evaluate.py`).
- `visualization/`: Code to create plots and charts (`visualize.py`).
- `config/`: Configuration files (`config.yaml`, `params.yaml`) and loaders.
- `utils/`: Helper functions used across the project (`helpers.py`).
- `__init__.py`: Makes each folder a Python package.

🧠 Think of this as your code library — clean, modular, and reusable.

---

## 📁 tests/ — How do you make sure your code works?
**Purpose**: Contains test scripts to check if your code is working correctly.

- `unit/`: Tests for individual functions or modules.
- `integration/`: Tests how different parts of the system work together.
- `fixtures/`: Sample data or setup code used in tests.

🧠 Like a safety net — helps catch bugs before they become problems.

---

## 📄 .env — Where do you keep secrets?
**Purpose**: Stores environment variables like API keys, database URLs, etc.

🧠 Like a vault — never commit this file to Git. Use `.gitignore` to keep it private.

---

## 📄 .gitignore — What should Git ignore?
**Purpose**: Tells Git which files/folders to skip (e.g., large files, secrets, cache).

Examples:
- `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`
- `data/`, `models/`, `.dvc/`
- `.env`, `.DS_Store`, `.log`

🧠 Keeps your repo clean and safe.

---

## 📄 requirements.txt — What does your project need to run?
**Purpose**: Lists all Python packages your project depends on.

🧠 Like a shopping list — run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install everything.

---

## 📄 README.md — What is this project about?
**Purpose**: The first thing people see — explains what your project does, how to use it, and how to contribute.

🧠 Like a welcome mat — make it clear, friendly, and helpful.

---

## 📄 setup.py — How do you install your project like a package?
**Purpose**: Makes your project installable with `pip install .`

- Defines metadata (name, version, dependencies).
- Useful for packaging and sharing your code.

🧠 Like a recipe card — tells Python how to “cook” your project into a package.

---

## 📄 Makefile — How do you automate common tasks?
**Purpose**: A shortcut file to run commands like `make train`, `make test`.

Example:
```make
train:
	python src/models/train.py
```
🧠 Like a remote control — press one button and it runs a whole script
